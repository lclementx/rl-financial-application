Foundations of Reinforcement Learning with Applications in Finance - Ashwin Rao, Tikhon Jelvis

By no means will I claim the structure of this code is mine - this comes from the book Foundations of Reinforcement Learning with Applications in Finance - Ashwin Rao, Tikhon Jelvis. It comes with a repository which you can refer to here: https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book/tree/master/rl

To emphasize, the value of the code base does NOT come from providing the code you need to solve rl problems, but rather a supplement to the textbook. The BETTER way to approach this is to read the entire book and follow through the book: https://stanford.edu/~ashlearn/RLForFinanceBook/book.pdf. It comes hand-in-hand with the book that lets you go through rl concepts in stages as you code up an OOP representation of each concept.

I am using this for my MSc in Big Data Technology - MAFS5370/MSBD6000M Reinforcement Learning with Financial Applications.

################## TAKE AWAYS ##################
* Don't REPLICATE the repository - go through the book and code it up as you go along
* Read and code at the same time - it helps to concretize what you have read by translating it into actual code
* When you don't understand the code - pause, take a step back and read through the pages again. The second time feels alot better
* Leave comments in the code! At points in the code I had to leave an example of what the output is to visualize/remind myself what it does.
* Follow through the examples - test the code out to see how it works :)
